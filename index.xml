Exploring Multiple Methods</title><link>https://en.poloxue.com/posts/2024-01-22-get-the-type-of-object-in-golang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 18:43:54 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://en.poloxue.com/posts/2024-01-22-get-the-type-of-object-in-golang/</guid><description>In Python, you can use type(x) to obtain the type of variable x. In JavaScript, typeof x returns the type of variable x. These operations are quite intuitive.
So, how do you quickly determine the type of a variable in Go?
Many beginners in Go might find themselves asking this question. This article will introduce several commonly used methods in Go to determine the type of a variable.
Go&amp;rsquo;s Type System In Go, each variable consists of two parts: type and value.</description></item><item><title>From Fatal Errors to sync.Map: Concurrency Strategies for Maps in Go.</title><link>https://en.poloxue.com/posts/2024-01-21-fatal-error-in-concurrent-accessing-map/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2024 17:15:14 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://en.poloxue.com/posts/2024-01-21-fatal-error-in-concurrent-accessing-map/</guid><description>Why does Go throw a fatal error, instead of a panic, when multiple goroutines concurrently access and modify the same map? This article will guide you through the underlying principles and introduce solutions to handle map concurrency issues in Go.
Map Data Race Firstly, let&amp;rsquo;s define a Map data race. It occurs when two or more goroutines access the same piece of data simultaneously without proper synchronization, and at least one of the goroutines modifies the data.</description></item><item><title>Exploring High-Efficiency int to string Conversion Strategies and Source Code in Go</title><link>https://en.poloxue.com/posts/2024-01-20-int-to-string-in-golang/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 17:47:23 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://en.poloxue.com/posts/2024-01-20-int-to-string-in-golang/</guid><description>In Go, converting an integer (int) to a string (string) is a common operation.

This article will detail several efficient methods for slice concatenation, discussing their pros and cons and appropriate use cases.
Why Concatenate Slices? In Go, slices are dynamic arrays used for storing and processing a series of data of the same type. Often, we need to merge two or more slices into a new one, such as when dealing with strings, lists of integers, or arrays of custom structures.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Timer Use in Go: Addressing Potential Memory Leaks</title><link>https://en.poloxue.com/posts/2024-01-14-efficient-timer-use-in-golang/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 15:16:48 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://en.poloxue.com/posts/2024-01-14-efficient-timer-use-in-golang/</guid><description>This post delves into the efficient use of timers in Go, particularly in conjunction with select statements, illustrating behavior patterns and best practices.

This question frequently surfaces on various community forums. When it comes to whether one should use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), everyone has their own viewpoint.
In the early days, programming didn&amp;rsquo;t necessitate an IDE as it was primarily centered around machine code. However, as the computer industry progressed, IDEs emerged to enhance engineering development efficiency.
It&amp;rsquo;s essential to grasp that an IDE primarily integrates various command tools into a user-friendly software, facilitating efficient programming practices.</description></item><item><title>MoviePy Basic Usage: Installation and Video Manipulation</title><link>https://en.poloxue.com/posts/2024-01-06-moving-basic-usage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2024 00:09:46 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://en.poloxue.com/posts/2024-01-06-moving-basic-usage/</guid><description>In an era dominated by short-form videos, numerous user-friendly editing software options exist.
